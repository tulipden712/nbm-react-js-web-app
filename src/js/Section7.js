                                                        What I like the most about being a PO is the collaboration with the development team in Vietnam. When I first started, it
                                                        was a bit difficult to understand
                                                        everything, mostly because the pronounciation
                                                        is different and it?s harder to communicate
                                                        via Skype than face to face with
                                                        someone I don?t know very well yet.
                                                        But now, it's not a problem at all.
                                                        If I don?t understand something or
                                                        have the feeling that there could
                                                        be a misunderstanding somewhere,
                                                        I just ask the team. My experience
                                                        with the working culture at Axon
                                                        Active has been great. The team is
                                                        very dedicated to the product we
                                                        are developing and they like working
                                                        together to overcome challenging
                                                        situations. There might be some differences
                                                        between Vietnamese and Swiss people,
                                                        but I see it as an opportunity to
                                                        explore another culture. When I come
                                                        to Vietnam, I always have lunch together
                                                        with the team and we organize a team
                                                        dinner. We often talk about how things
                                                        are in Vietnam and how it?s different
                                                        to Switzerland. The teams we work
                                                        with in Vietnam apply the Scrum framework
                                                        which allows us as a team to get
                                                        feedback very quickly and to learn
                                                        from it, as a critical factor of
                                                        improvement. And for our customers,
                                                        we can show them the software after
                                                        each iteration and get their feedback.
                                                        This is the biggest advantage of
                                                        Agile and Scrum. In a world with
                                                        requirements changing fast and often,
                                                        it?s very important that you can
                                                        respond to those changes in a fast
                                                        and inexpensive way - and Agile allows
                                                        you to do that. It might take some
                                                        time to change the mindset but once
                                                        you understand what Agile is about,
                                                        it is very beneficial. Thanks to

                                                        My experience with Axon Active is very good. It gives us the possibility to find software engineers faster to start developing
                                                        our new product. I really enjoy working
                                                        with the team. All team members are
                                                        very motivated. They also bring in
                                                        new ideas how the software could
                                                        be developed in a better way. I appreciate
                                                        that they think about it and really
                                                        have the go to develop a good product,
                                                        which is very important to Soreco
                                                        and our customers. It was quite challenging
                                                        at the beginning. I had to get used
                                                        to working via Skype or GoToMeeting,
                                                        which don?t provide direct contact.
                                                        I also only have the morning to work
                                                        with the team since they leave their
                                                        office in my afternoon time. But
                                                        everything works good now. I come
                                                        to Vietnam every 2 or 3 months to
                                                        see the team. People are very friendly
                                                        and helpful. This brings a lot of
                                                        improvements in the general communication,
                                                        not only in business matters. At
                                                        Axon Active, we work in Agile. The
                                                        methodology has given us a lot of
                                                        possibilities to make changes in
                                                        the project and product. It is really
                                                        flexible. When you see a better solution
                                                        you can adjust your software development
                                                        process, which is very important
                                                        to making a high quality product.

                                                        H&L made the decision to transform the company and its practices into a more agile way of doing things. When we embarked
                                                        on that journey we experienced a
                                                        lot of challenges implementing Agile
                                                        across our development team. It was
                                                        refreshing when we started engaging
                                                        with Axon Active. Their understanding
                                                        and practice of Agile were at a very
                                                        high level. We really appreciate
                                                        the way in which they embrace this
                                                        new way of working, particularly
                                                        in software development. And that
                                                        has been beneficial for us, because
                                                        we are able to align our systems
                                                        and processes to work harmoniously
                                                        with Axon Active and produce the
                                                        most valuable outcome. We have 2
                                                        teams at Axon Active and they both
                                                        are very collaborative in their approach
                                                        to user stories in particular and
                                                        business rules, business logic and
                                                        outcomes. The teams are very eager
                                                        to move forward and provide another
                                                        level of knowledge depth to our process.
                                                        So far we?ve been happy with the
                                                        outcome. The more diverse our teams
                                                        are the more insights we get. Communication
                                                        was a big challenge at the start,
                                                        due to the language barrier and the
                                                        time difference. But we?ve been developing
                                                        better systems to communicate and
                                                        we are getting better at communication
                                                        and collaboration between the teams
                                                        in Australia and Vietnam. The team?s
                                                        productivity and velocity are increasing
                                                        now and we?re getting great output.
                                                        The offshore teams and in-house team
                                                        are working together to achieve a
                                                        common goal and a common outcome.
                                                        We also just started the process
                                                        of automation testing which is very
                                                        new and exciting for us. We?re confident
                                                        that Axon Active has the skillset
                                                        and the knowledge to be able to help
                                                        us from the ground up. They have
                                                        the understanding, the knowledge,
                                                        the tools, the framework, the architecture
                                                        to make testing efficient. Overall
                                                        it has been positive experience so
                                                        far. We?re happy with the way Axon

                                                        happy with the way they embrace the
                                                        Agile and the Scrum framework because
                                                        we did the same at H&L. It?s been
                                                        a really good engine for the execution
                                                        of our development projects. We?ve
                                                        proven that the productivity of offshoring
                                                        our development is a beneficial one
                                                        and one that we want to continue.We
                                                        have a cross-functional team at Axon
                                                        Active, with a German product owner.
                                                        The team is extremely motivated and
                                                        always delivers high quality results.

                                                        including personal help from Axon?s
                                                        Branch Manager if necessary. We visited
                                                        the Axon Active offices several times
                                                        were pleased with the working standards.

                                                        are equal to any software development

                                                        In general I can testify that the
                                                        company motto "We do what we say,

                                                        for a partner to support us in applying
                                                        the same concepts in offshore development
                                                        teams. We found this agile partnership
                                                        with Axon Active Vietnam, and started
                                                        with one scrum development team,
                                                        which grew quickly to 8 teams. Our
                                                        teams are cross-functional development
                                                        teams with a Swiss product owner.
                                                        These teams work in various areas:
                                                        - Develop new products based on our

                                                        (JEE) - Maintain and extend existing
                                                        products (BPM and/or Java) - Develop
                                                        customer specific solutions (customer
                                                        projects) We are very happy with
                                                        the commitment of the teams to deliver
                                                        high quality results that make our
                                                        customers happy. Of course, this
                                                        would not be possible without the
                                                        excellent support of Axon Active.
                                                        We definitely recommend Axon Active
                                                        Vietnam as an ideal partner for software

                                                        Metabiota started with a small group of engineers and we have grown the remote teams over time. Our partnership with Axon
                                                        Active begins with the QA team, formed
                                                        early this year with 5 QA engineers.
                                                        In the same year, we decided to build
                                                        a development team which I have the
                                                        opportunity to directly work with,
                                                        through the warm up and on board
                                                        process. Eventually, we combine the
                                                        2 teams into a united team. We actually
                                                        like the teams. After given some
                                                        learning time, the team has now developed
                                                        and grown on their expertise. They
                                                        inherit technical stack that Metabiota
                                                        is using, especially Big Data technology.
                                                        Each of the team member is very independent
                                                        and committed. They are passionate
                                                        and willing to learn new things or
                                                        pick up challenges. They also have
                                                        great courage to actually overcome
                                                        a lot of difficulties, for example,
                                                        improving their English pronunciation.
                                                        The team is now more self-organizing
                                                        in a way that they are able to initiate
                                                        new approach to deliver product features
                                                        and contribute to improving quality
                                                        of Metabiota project in a cleverer
                                                        way. At the beginning, there were
                                                        some difficulties in getting to know
                                                        each other better between our in-house
                                                        and offshore teams, mainly due to
                                                        differences in language and technical
                                                        background. We had to show the team
                                                        how we usually solve the problems
                                                        so they could follow our thinking,
                                                        because there are so many different
                                                        ways to approach or solve a particular
                                                        problem. We have a data analytics
                                                        code background so we might approach
                                                        some problems based on data analytics
                                                        and big data. We?d like to see more
                                                        of that in the team, which means
                                                        there are always new things to learn
                                                        for the team, keeping them excited.
                                                        I especially like the way people
                                                        work at Axon Active. They are very
                                                        active in communication and collaboration
                                                        within the same team, and between
                                                        SM, QA and developers. I also think
                                                        Agile and Scrum is one the strength
                                                        that we can see. It actually aligns
                                                        with the process that we?re doing
                                                        at Metabiota. We might be a little
                                                        bit different in development process,
                                                        but in term of the spirit, it?s pretty
                                                                                        much the same. </p>

                                                        implement and maintain all our main
                                                        products. Additionally, we setup
                                                        a testing team that covers the product
                                                        and business testing. Over this period
                                                        we implemented new software, changed
                                                        old software and we were able to
                                                        increase the software quality overall.
